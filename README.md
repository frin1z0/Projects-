#BITMAP MESSAGE 
#This program displays a user's message using a two-color 2D image represented by a multiline string, allowing for experimentation with different messages.

#More in detail:
#In this
#bitmap, space characters represent an empty space,
#and all other characters are replaced by characters in
#the user’s message. The provided bitmap resembles
#a world map, but you can change this to any image
#you’d like. The binary simplicity of the space-or-message-characters
#system makes it good for begin-
#ners. Try experimenting with different messages to
#see what the results look like!
