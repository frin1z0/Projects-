When not playing DVDs, they
would display a diagonally traveling DVD logo
that bounced off the edges of the screen. This pro-
gram simulates this colorful DVD logo by making it
change direction each time it hits an edge. It also
keeps track of how many times a logo hits a corner of
the screen. This creates an interesting visual anima-
tion to look at, especially for the magical moment
when a logo lines up perfectly with a corner.
